### Overview of the analysis:
In this analysis, we looked at the bikesharing data for august in New York City. The reason behind the Analysis is to pitch the idea of bringin bikesharing to Des Moines. We can analyzed various types of data and created a presentarion to get a scope of who uses de bikesharing, how it is used and why it is used. Of course Des Moines is not NYC int erms of tourism or population, however we can see NYC bikesharing as business model which could be replicated in Des Moines.

### Results: 
we created a set of 7 diferent charts to analyse the data. We analyzeddiferent aspects, such as usage habits by day of the week, hour of the day, gender, ride duration.

We can see there a slight peak in bike usage from 7 am to 9 am, probably due to work commute. We can also notice that peak hours of bike usage is from 4 pm to 8 pm. This might be due to work commute and tourist leisure.

We can see a dense concentration of bike rides in the most concentrated office and tourist zones of the city.

We can observe bike durations tend to be around 5 minutes long, and the count descends as duration rises, with most rides being less than an hour long. We can deduct users use them to move quickly through the city and not to do long rides.

It's clear that users identified as male ride the bikes more often than female and unkown users. We can see male peak at 5 minuts, while female peak at 6 minutes. Men tend to use it more, while female tend tu use it longer. Unkown gender tend tu use it for longer periods, while there are significantly less uers.

We can see that during work days, users tend to use the bikes more frequenty before and after office hours. During weekends the usage is spread between daylight times. We can decuct weekday rides are for comute and weekend for leissure activities.

We can see the same tendencies we saw in the previous charts. Weekdays tend to be used before and after office hours and weekends spread thoughout the day. We can also see stronger male usage compared to female usage.


<img width="949" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-26 a la(s) 20 00 34" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85461477/134831314-d8e1ebd8-e76e-4afa-8349-4a52cc30bc77.png">
We created a rather interesting Heatmap. We separated Customers and subscibers, then we separated them by gender, finally we sorted the usage habits by day of then week to see when each category uses the bikesharing rides. There's a lot going on in this heatmap. First we can observe a greater usage of the bikes by suscribers than customers. Which means rides are used frequently by users whith a subscription. Then we can analyze customers use it more during weekends and suscribers more during work days. This can be impoirtant beacuse we can deduct that tourist costumers don't interfere with work commute suscribers.


### Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
After we analyzed the given data, we can deduct the following conclusions:
- The main reason for usage is work commute and tourism.
- Suscribers tend to use the bikes for work commute and costumers for leisure activities.
- Male users tend to use the bikesharing far more than females and unkown users.
- Female users tend to go for longer rides than men, while unkown users tenf to go on longer rides.
- Unkown gener users could probably be tourists, who use the bikes on weekends and for longer rides.

I think we should consider the following visualizations to ger a better scope of the busiess model.
- Average distance of each ride.
- Number of kilometers before bikes get to maintenance.

With this data we can see if the bikesharing is profitable, and how pften should bikes go inte maintenance.
